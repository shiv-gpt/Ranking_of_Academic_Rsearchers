# Ranking of Academic Rsearchers

This repository is a way of creating a new metric for ranking Academic researchers instead of the popular but inaccurate h-index, g-index or i10 metrics.
Our Method is built on top of the famous PageRank Algorithm. 

The main notebook is page_rank_base1-dblp7-Copy1-2_12.ipynb. The project report can be found in report.pdf .
